[h1]General Information[/h1]

This is a re-release of the mod AGoT: Knight Tree from the original creator, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/lenkiri]Mayonez_kun[/url].

This mod lets you track the creation of knights over time. When a character grants knighthood to someone, they become a descendant in that character's knight tree. This allows you to view the origin and descent of knights hundreds of years into the future.

The tree will show you the amount of members it has, as well as the birth and death years of each knight.

The button will appear when a character has a knight tree, it is located between the "Liege" and "Primary Heir" portraits in the character window.

If the button doesn't work when trying to view a dead character's knight tree, it means that all of that character's knight descendants are also dead. The knight tree is deleted in these instances to help with performance.
